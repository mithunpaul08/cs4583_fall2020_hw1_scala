# Setup your environment

You will need to set up an appropriate coding environment on whatever computer
you expect to use for this assignment.
Minimally, you should install:
 
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)



# Write your code

You will implement one function each for each of the sub qns, Eg:`runQ5_1()` inside 
the class `InvertedIndex`. These functions should return the documents as asked in the question, as a String array. 


Also, you **should not edit** these files:
- `runAllTests.sh`
- `.travis.yml`
- `src/test/resources/input.txt`
- `src/test/scala/edu/arizona/cs/QueryEngineTest.scala`

# To run your code
To run your scala code, do `sbt clean` and `sbt run` script from the directory containing `build.sbt`
