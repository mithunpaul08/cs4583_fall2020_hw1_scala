Introduction
------------

This dataset comes from the Lingspam Dataset, specifically, the lemm-stop subset. The emails have been edited to remove punctuation and standalone numbers. The "Subject" word that begins each email has been removed. Additionally, all tabs and newlines have been collapsed to a single space.

This dataset was created for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course at Stanford:

The data itself was generated by Ion Androutsopoulos.


Data Description
----------------

The dataset you will be working with is split into two subsets: a 700-email subset for training and a 260-email subset for testing. Each of the training and testing subsets contain 50% spam messages and 50% nonspam messages. Additionally, the emails have been preprocessed in the following ways:

1. Stop word removal: Certain words like "and," "the," and "of," are very common in all English sentences and are not very meaningful in deciding spam/nonspam status, so these words have been removed from the emails.

2. Lemmatization: Words that have the same meaning but different endings have been adjusted so that they all have the same form. For example, "include", "includes," and "included," would all be represented as "include." All words in the email body have also been converted to lower case.

3. Removal of non-words: Numbers and punctuation have both been removed. All white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) have all been trimmed to a single space character.
